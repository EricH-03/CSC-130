<p> Hello! Welcome to Eric Huber's Project Page for Project 2 in CSC 130! </p>
</div>

<div class="p1il">
<h1><u> Part 1: Items 1-8 </u></h1>
<ol>
	<li><b>What is the idea that you have for your app?</b>
	<br> A pomodoro study helper app for students!
	</li>
	<li><b>What part is 2D and what part is 3D?</b><br>
	The 2D part is the majority of the web app including the timer and all the controls. The 3D part comes when
	the timer has a 5 minute break which will include AR games and other 3D games! <br>
	</li>
	<li><b>What is your original, simple, hypothesis about this app?</b><br>
	The hypothesis is a webapp to help students study more frequently, effectively and enjoy the experience more! <br>
	</li>
	<li><b>Why is this idea important or needed in the world?</b><br>
	This idea solves the need for students who often find it difficult to start studying, have trouble maintaing focus 
	and get sucked into their work. Further more the pomodoro method has been shown to be one of the most time effective 
	studying methods and a good web-app could help spread this technique even further <br>
	<li><b>How do you plan to use XR emotionally to immerse the user in the experience?</b><br>
	We will mainly be using AR where we will have little web-app games designed to fill the 5 minutes of
	break time with fun, brain refreshing games! 
	</li>
	<li><b>List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not good for XR.</b><br>
	It is go for XR because it helps add a unique element to an otherwise pretty basic web-app <br>
	It helps immerse the user into the web-app <br>
	It can be cumbersome to implement and demanding on your system <br>
	</li>
	<li><b>List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not better in 3D.</b><br>
	It makes the games/breaktime much more interesting <br>
	It expands the possibilties of what is possible to add in the break time <br>
	It could take extra load time which could be problematic <br>
	</li>
	<li><b>In what way is each of AR, MR and VR possibly useful for the project?</b><br>
	AR and MR could be used for fun enviroment based games and filters during breaktime <br>
	VR could be used to create an entirely immersive study experience and incredible games during break time <br> 
	</li>

	<h1><u> Part 2: Items 9-11 </u></h1>
<ol start="9">
	<li><b id="helo"> Auditing your idea</b><br>
	
		Yes, this idea exists in 2D. There are lots of free timers and even some aimed at Pomodoro
		studying. But these are often hard to use, hard to change the time on and aren't very immersive. They 
		are often easy to start using which I like.<br><br>
		
		
		 Yes, this idea exists in 3D, somewhat. I am not immediately farmilar with anything that fufills the
		same purpose with 3D. There are some 3D clocks out there and they look really good and are incredibly immersive. 
		They are often not very easy to use which I don't like. <br><br>
		
		
		 It can make the project incredibly immersive during the break time, which helps make the
		process of studying so much more fun! <br><br>
	
	</li>
	<li><b id="helo"> Design Principles</b><br><br>
	<b>Useful: </b> the app will have a pop up warning if you try to close it during study time. <br>
	<b>Usable:</b> by having an intuitve date and time slider.<br>
			<b>Desirable:</b> by incoporating 3D/XR elements we make the experience enjoyable/fun for the users<br>
			<b>Valuable:</b> by having a impact on the quailty of our users studying <br>
			<b>Findable:</b> by having the start button centered on the screen  <br>
			<b>Accessible and Inclusive:</b> by ensuring the webapp is usuable without navigation

				<b>Says:</b>
				<ol><li> Is this useful?</li>
					<li> Are the games interesting? </li>
					<li> Will this help me study? </li>
				</ol>
				
				<b>Thinks:</b>
				<ol><li>This is a good idea!</li>
					<li> This is easy to use and customize</li>
