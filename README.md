# CSC-130
Repositoy for the World Wide Web and Mobile Applications (CSC 130) course I took the Summer semester of my first year at University. This course was a project-based introduction to modern Web-based mobile applications which focused on both 2D and 3D design strategies and deployment technologies. In the course we covered mainly HTML, CSS, JQuery and JavaScript. Lectures also intensively covered new Cyberspace opportunities defined by Metaverse and Omniverse initiatives

Topics included design processes such as framing, prototyping, and skeuomorphism, as well as deployment processes associated with introductory programming, development tools, and rendering.
