    <h1>My HTML Project #1</h1>

    <h2>A traditional web app to facilate a monthly mystery box for used books and novels!</h2>

    <p>The idea is to have the user fill out a survey based on their reading preferences and other useful personality-based questions and then group them based on that data to sell monthly mystery boxes with 5 novels based on their answers. Two of which they can keep for no additional charge, with the option to purchase any other book they'd like.
	</p>

    <p> Reading preference questions could include favourite books, genres, authors but also 
   books they like to avoid or authors they despise. The personality preference will mainly focus
	on other media interests and offer another potential predictor the types of novels they enjoy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I think this web app effectively targets budjet concious readers. It would be almost impossible
	to compete with the big players in the industry on sheer volume so by creqting a sense of mystery
    and comunnity. This can be done by creating an almost social media like atmosphere, provide benefits
	to the users for sharing information and pictures, we could incorporate AR filters to further 
    insentivse this.	
	</p>
	


    <h2>There are numerous ways to further develop this idea, like for example
	a "Favorites box" where we sell a box the site wide top 5 novels from all the users.</h2>
