		<h3>Part 1: Items 1-11</h3>
	<p>
		<ol type="I"> 
			<li>Item 1: </li>
				<p>The idea for my app is essentially a "Rent-A-Bee" service where local beekeepers are matched with users
				who would benefit with a beehive in their backyards.
				</p>
		
			<li>Item 2: </li>
				<p> The main 2D aspects are surveys in which the specfic desire of the user is matched 
				with the offering of a beekeeper. There would also be a built in messaging service so 
				that beekeepers and users can be put into contact without exchanging other means of contact.
				<br>
				<br>
				The main 3D parts are an AR modeling system where you can visualize the beehive in 3D space
				inorder to see if it fits size wize or with other decor.
				</p>
		
			<li>Item 3: </li>
			<p> A webapp to facillitate interactions with beekeepers and our users
			in order to rent out beehives to help pollenate their garden or help
			sell their eco-friendly life style.
			</p>
		
			<li>Item 4: </li>
			<p> Bee populations have been steadily on the decline for years. 
			Many beekeepers don't have the space or ecological diversity
			on their properties to support the number of constantly 
			growing hives. Urban enviroments provide the a perfect solution
			to this and help both the user with their garden and the beekeepers
			with their issue this win-win also helps the enviroment and hopefully
			the bee population.
			</p>
		
			<li>Item 5: </li>
			<p> By having a AR system where you can virtually place a beehive 
			and receive feedback on it's location, (ie is it big enough, level enough
			, etc..) but also imagine how a beehive would look in their backyard.
			How busy is it? Which way could the bees be flying? All these
			would immerse our user into my application.
			</p>
			
			<li>Item 6: </li>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li> This works well in XR because it helps the user visualize</li>
					<li> This doesn't work well in XR because it adds a certain technolgical barrier of entry </li>
					<li> It works because it helps immerse the person into this possibility</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<li>Item 7: </li>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>This idea is better in 3D because it helps the user really imagine what it could be like </li>
					<li> 3D lends the idea credibiltiy, surely no one would put in this much effort if the idea wasn't sound </li>
					<li> It would make the idea harder to implement </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<li>Item 8: </li>
			<p>AR is useful to picture the beehive and plan your space accordingly. MR could be useful
			to interact with the space around the beehive and VR would be great to fully immerse yourself and imagineh
			how the bee's might interact with the beehive.
			</p>
			
			<li>Item 9: </li>
			<p><b>Does this idea exist in 2D?</b><br>
			Yes, this idea exists as most of the infrastructure is 
			all 2D. For example, the built in communication features. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Does this idea exist in 3D? </b><br>
			While not existing entirely in 3D there are certainly 3D elements in
			my project such as the beehive visualization in which 3D is required to 
			properly imagine the beehive on their property.<br><br>
			
			<b>What could you do in your project in 3D that you can't do in 2D?</b><br>
			The visualization of the beehive would be completely impossible in 2D and requires
			3D to even be remotely useful.<br>
			</p>
			
			<li>Item 10: </li>
			<p> <b>Useful:</b> because it helps facillitate a useful interaction in which both parties and
			the bees benefit <br>
			<b>Usable:</b> by keeping the implementation as simple as reasonable, and copying succesful webapps UIs
			<br>
			<b>Desirable:</b> by incoporating 3D/XR elements we make the experience enjoyable/fun for the users<br>
			<b>Valuable:</b> by helping maintain bee population and providing communites with better pollenated plants <br>
			<b>Findable</b> due to it's unique idea and the fact that it would be targeted at just Victoria, it would be made 
			available in those places. <br>
			<b>Accessible and Inclusive:</b> by ensuring the webapp is compatiable with screen-readers and by focusing on a simple
			UI
			</p>
			
			<li>Item 11: </li>
			<p> The empathy map! <br>
	
				<b>Says:</b>
				<ul><li> Is this safe?</li>
					<li> Does this work on other devices? </li>
					<li> Where do I start? </li>
				</ul>
				
				<b>Thinks:</b>
				<ul><li>This can be a little bit overwhelming</li>
					<li> Do I trust a stranger on my property?</li>
					<li> Is this AR element really necessary? </li>
				</ul>
					
				<b>Does: </b>
				<ul><li> Try out the virtual beehive </li>
					<li> Ask friends if they have used the webapp </li>
					<li> Researches more about beehives/beekeeping </li>
				</ul>
				
				<b>Feels: </b>
				<ul><li>Excited</li>
					<li> Unsure who to trust </li>
					<li> Worried</li>

		<h3>Part 2 & Wireframe</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Final Hypothesis Statement: </b><br>
		 A webapp to facillitate interactions with beekeepers and our users
		in order to rent out beehives to help pollenate their garden or help
		sell their eco-friendly life style using UX elements <br>
		<br>
			<b>Brainstorm:</b><br>
		What were the ideas, outcomes, insights and what was thrown out:<br> 
		<br>Outcomes:
			<ul><li>Increased clarity</li>
				<li>Better understanding what is required during implementation </li>
				<li>Clearer focus on where to go next </li>
				<li>Increased focus and motivation </li>
			</ul>
			
		Ideas: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Start with static implementation first </li>
			<li> Finalize wireframe on paper but be aware it might have to change in implementation </li>
			<li> Focus on different tabs during webpages </li>	
		</ul><br>
		Insights:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>It is important to keep it SIMPLE </li>
			<li>Two landing pages for Beekeepers/users </li>
			<li>Accessibilty is REALLY important to this project</li>	
		</ul><br>
		
		Ideas that are thrown out: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating a social media like system within the webapp </li>
			<li>Exactly match project to wireframe</li>
			<li>More features = more users</li>	
		</ul>
