	<h3><b><u>Why Rent Our Your Hives?</u></b></h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Rent-A-Bee offers a new service where we put you (the beekeepers) in contact with people in your area (our landlords) that have some extra space that would benefit from some extra hives. The question is, why? Why rent out your hives? Well, our service is for beekeepers with more hives than they do space! People living in town are noticing that they have fewer pollinators flying around. Having a beehive helps them remain environmentally conscious and get their garden to bloom a little bit better. It's a mutually beneficial exchange; the landlords get a nicer garden, you get healthier bees, more varieties of honey and all the space you could ever need! <br>
